# Exercises

**Exercise 1**: compare different openMPI algorithms for the Broadcast and Gather collective operations (more details [here](exercise1/)).

**Exsercise 2**: generate Mandelbrot set with an hybrid OpenMP + MPI approach and measure the scaling (more details [here](exercise2/)).

## About the exercises

- **Exercise 1**: compare different openMPI algorithms for the following collective operations: Broadcast and Barrier (more details [here](exercise1/))
- **Exercise 2B**: hybrid implementation of the QuickSort algorithm (more details [here](exercise2/))
